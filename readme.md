### Step-by-step summary and explanation of the event loop phases and their execution order:
---
1. **Timers phase**: This phase executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` with a due time. If there are no timers due, the event loop proceeds to the next phase.

2. **I/O callbacks phase**: This phase executes almost all callbacks except for close callbacks, timers, and `setImmediate()`. It processes the I/O queue until the queue is exhausted or the next timer is due.

3. **Idle, prepare phase**: This phase is used internally by Node.js and is not relevant to the execution order.

4. **Poll phase**: This phase retrieves new I/O events. If there are no timers due and no tasks in the queue, it checks for `setImmediate()` callbacks and executes them. If there are no `setImmediate()` callbacks, it blocks for I/O and waits.

5. **Check phase**: This phase executes `setImmediate()` callbacks.

6. **Close callbacks phase**: This phase executes close callbacks, such as `socket.on('close', ...)`.

Regarding `process.nextTick()` and Promise callbacks, they are considered microtasks. The event loop processes microtasks before executing the next callback/task in the same phase. Here's the corrected version of your summary:

1. **Timers phase**: Are there any timers due? If yes, execute timer callbacks and then process microtasks.
2. **I/O callbacks phase**: Are there any I/O callbacks? If yes, execute I/O callbacks and then process microtasks.
3. **Poll phase**: Are there any timers due? If no, are there any tasks in the queue? If no, execute `setImmediate()` callbacks and then process microtasks.

```
This diagram shows that process.nextTick() and microtasks are executed after the current task in any phase and after the complete task in the current phase, before moving on to the next phase.

```

// process.nextTick() will be called after current process is finished in any phase
while (TIMERS_OR_EVENTS_POSSIBLE) {
    if (shouldExecuteTimers(now)) doExecuteExpiredTimers();
    handleProcessNextTick();
    while (callback = pollForEvents() && count++ < MAX_POLL) {
      if (callback.eventType === 'close') {
        addToCloseQueue(callback);
        continue;
      }
      callback();
    }
    handleProcessNextTick();
    if (setImmediateQueue) runSetImmediateQueue();
    handleProcessNextTick();
    if (closeQueue) runCloseQueue();
    handleProcessNextTick();
  }
  ```
